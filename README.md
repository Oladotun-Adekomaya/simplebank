Today, i used sqlc to generate CRUD Golang code from SQL.

sqlc generates fully type-safe idiomatic Go code from SQL. Hereâ€™s how it works:

You write SQL queries

You run sqlc to generate Go code that presents type-safe interfaces to those queries

You write application code that calls the methods sqlc generated
